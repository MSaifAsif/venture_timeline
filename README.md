# Venture Timeline

A chronological arrangement of list of things to take care of when starting a venture.

# Background

Working in the software industry, I often came across a situation where a green field project needed to be setup. This meant, figuring out what kind of tools to use, how to maintain documentation, sprint tracking, deployment, CI/CD, ops, support and the list goes on and on.

I finally decided to write this all down once for myself so instead of trying to remember all the things, I would just have a checklist of things to follow in a timely order and I wouldn't miss something cruicial. The numbering of the [list items](#list-index) does not signify any ordering, any step can be done in any order. The scope is what matters more i.e what to do at which stage of the project.


# How to read this

## Scope
The size of the project. No matter what you are making, a university year end project or a large scale enterprise search engine, there is a certain size of this project. For the sake of simplicity, this docuemnt uses __P__ (prototype, MVP-1 or version 0.1), __S__ (small univerity activity, freelancer project, early stage startup), __M__ (medium sized business, paying customers) and __L__ (large enterprise, big client base, higher stakes) to differentiate the different complexities based on level 1 t-shirt size.

## Epoch

The time when to do this task or effort. Is it something early ? Can it be postponed to a later stage ? Or is it something completely out of the scope of this timeline. For this document, I will use __Step-1__ as something that needs to be done before anything, __Early__ is something to be taken care of in the very early stages, __Later__ Something that can be done in parallel or maybe even postponed to a future stage of the project, __Post live__ Something to be taken care of in very later stages, stuff that can be postponed until e.g after MVP-1 is live or when some users are already using your product.

## Getting started [&#8593;](#list-index)

### What is this :

Somethings you need to ask yourself before you jump into the venture. You need to be absolutely sure about answering the ultimate question; *What is the problem you are trying to solve here*. Think outside the box, come up with anykind of way on how you want to come up with an answer to this, ask more poeple or search online. Basically do extensive research here. This is the part where you commit yourself to your idea. And you need to be 100% vested into it.

### Timeline

| What To Do | Epoch | Scope    | How To Do          |
| ------- | ------|--------------- |--------------|
| Requirements   | Step-1   |      P/S/M/L       |Sit down with yourself and answer the question: What are you trying to solve ? How do you plan to do it, and what is the [Definition Of Done](?) ?|
| Market research   | Step-1  |     P/S/M/L         |Research about existing solutions out there. How does your solution differentiate? What is the Competition out there looking like.|
| Cost Analysis   | Early      |     M/L     |What is the status of your pocket looking like vs what you plan to achieve.|
| Interview people   | Post Live  |   M/L            |Ask relavant people out in the market what they think about your solution. Would anyone invest time and money in your idea?|

## Development Tools [&#8593;](#list-index)

### What is this ?

The tools are an extension of your creative mind. Your project will materialize from these tools and your idea will manifest into something physical using these tools. Choose wisely.

### Timeline

| What To Do | Epoch | Scope    | How To Do          |
| ------- | ------|--------------- |--------------|
| IDEs   | Step-1   |      P/S/M/L       |Whether a single person or a team of engineers, find a tool that you are familiar with. Favor community based free and open source ones.
| Licensing   | Early   |      S/M/L       |Lots of libraries and tools out there are not exactly freen & open source. Some require certain policies and rules to be followed. Avoid unnecessary legal battles by addressing this early|


## Project Management [&#8593;](#list-index)

### What is this ?
A way of managing and visualizing incoming work and outgoing results. Visualizations and demographics are far more interesting and tell a lot as compared to mediocre emails and chat messages.

### Timeline

| What To Do | Epoch | Scope    | How To Do          |
| ------- | ------|--------------- |--------------|
| Ticketing System   | Step-1   |      S/M/L       |A good ticket management system to manage and structure tasks. Cheap tools exist|
| Work flows  | Early   |      M/L       |What needs to be done first? Set priorities. What comes next? How does a working task move forward in e.g swimlanes of a kanban baord|
| Customer Support  | Later   |      M/L       |Find a way to manage feedback coming in from customrs and/or market to keep users happy|
| Professional Project Managers  | Early   |      M/L       |Invest in good and certified professionals to help you manage your project better.|
